This repository contains a Python Tkinter project designed to automate the task of 
splitting up and sending texts to the OpenAI API. While initially developed for novels,
the GUI allows for the modification of the prompt, making it versatile for various use-cases.

Features
Graphical User Interface for easy interaction
Automated splitting of large texts into manageable segments
Customizable prompts for OpenAI API
Designed with novels in mind, but versatile for other types of text

Usage

To run the project, simply execute the interface.py script. This will launch the GUI, 
allowing you to load texts, set prompts, and download the responses to a .txt file.

The curent version is almost certainly very buggy and limited. If you find this project useful tell
me about bugs and issues you discover with it or features you'd like added. Also contributions are
very welcome.
